# Austin Hansen's Blog

I am a web developer with two years of experience building production applications with Ruby on Rails. Computers and software have been a major part of my life, from my familyâ€™s first Apple IIe to building my own computers and provisioning Linux based servers. I am passionate about programming, and love the endless supply of new concepts and technologies to discover and improve.
